# Code a website demonstration

## Local website

Use VS Code to write your code. Use Google Chrome to view your local website, and use Chrome's developer tools to see the code in action / debug your site / inspect other websites.

- VS Code
- Google Chrome & developer tools

## HTML

Copy and alter the `index_template.html` file. Be sure to rename it `index.html` as this is the necessary name for any homepage. Like a contents page for a book!

- w3schools HTML reference

## CSS

Copy and alter the `styles-template.css` file. Uncomment the stylesheet line in your `index.html` file. As long as these two files are in the same folder, this will start adding the CSS to your HTML. The template styles are boring (and designed to look ok on a mobile) but this is where you come in! Have fun exploring the different CSS attributes you can use. For example, my `styles.css` is what I've used.

- w3schools CSS reference
- unsplash (free to use unlike google images)
- flaticon (free to use, you just need to credit flaticon)
- google fonts (free!)

### Live / Cloud website

Create a GitHub account (example: my username is `themathematicalmermaid`). Create a repo (example: mine is called `site`). Upload your `index.html` file and your `styles.css` file. Upload any images you referenced. In your repo settings, scroll down to the section on GitHub Pages. Choose to publish your master branch. This page will reload, and the pages link will now display your live site's URL which will use your username and repo name (example: my live site is <a href="https://themathematicalmermaid.github.io/site/">themathematicalmermaid.github.io/site/</a>)

Your site can now be visited by anyone connected to the internet!

### jQuery & mySQL

Copy and alter the `script.js` file. Uncomment the `jquery` and `script.js` lines in the `head` of your HTML index file.

Want to develop your site further? Look at jQuery or JavaScript, and mySQL for a database.
